This folder contains the sample code used during the session.

The project was created with Visual Studio 2017, but it should also work with older version of Visual Studio.

Visual Studio requires Windows or Mac. A free version of Visual Studio is available: Search for **Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition**. But be warned: Visual Studio is a very large IDE, so don't be surprised if you have to download more than 10GB...

Although I haven't tried it, it should be possible to migrate the project to .NET Core and run it under Linux...

Basic usage:

After opening the solution, build the project. This should install all dependencies (3rd party libs) automatically via NuGet.
